# Django-Articles-app
In this Django project, I created my own classes which are (OwnerListView, OwnerDetailView, OwnerCreateView, OwnerUpdateView, OwnerDeleteView). These classes are created by extending the generic view classes of Django. For the OwnerCreateView, I overrode the "form_valid" function in the CreateView to be able to add the user or the owner of the article to its object before saving it to the database. For the OwnerUpdateView and OwnerDeleteView classes, I overrode the "get_queryset" function from the genric classes so that it filters the retrieved model to check the user. The main advantage of my classes is that a user can take actions that are specific to him where no other user can perform them. For example, if a user created an article then, only this user can edit or delete it.
